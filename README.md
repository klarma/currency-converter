## Description

The currency calculator is another project that aims to show my basic knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS. It contains *BEM, ES6+ features: const, let, bloki*. I don't use more advanced solutions but instead ** I pay attention to details when writing the code and the ability to work in accordance with good practices **. The correctness of my work is supervised by [Krzysztof Dąbrowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dabrowskisoftware) - an experienced Senior Software Engineer.
